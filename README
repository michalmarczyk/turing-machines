# turing-machines

A Turing machine emulator in Clojure.

## Usage

(compile-turing-program & instructions) produces a Clojure function
which, when passed two lists representing the initial contents of the
tape, will execute the programme given by the instructions.

The first list is a list of positions to the left of the machine head,
starting from the one immediately to the right of the current position
(thus it goes right-to-left).  The second list starts with the cell
the machine head is hovering over, with the cells to the right
following.  Should the machine head move pass the end of the tape
fragment described by the initial two lists, padding with false
happens automatically.

make-tape and numbers-to-tape provide convenient means of constructing
tape descriptions.  final-tape and final-number extract information
from machine run results.
